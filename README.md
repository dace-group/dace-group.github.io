## Overview

The **DACE** (Data structures and Algorithms for Computational science and Engineering) is a research group devoted to the study of algorithms, complexity theory, and data structures for computational science and engineering applications. We use a variety of mathematical and computational tools to study natural, social, physical, and engineering phenomena.

## Topics

Here are some subject areas we devote our attention to:
* Data Privacy, Trust, and Security
* Relational Learning on Graph, Scientific, and Statistical Databases

Other Data Engineering topics
