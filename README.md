## Overview

The **DACE** (**D**ata structures and **A**lgorithms for **C**omputational science and **E**ngineering) is a research group devoted to the study of algorithms, complexity theory, and data structures for computational science and engineering applications. We use a variety of mathematical and computational tools to study natural, social, physical, and engineering phenomena.

## Topics

Here are some subject areas we devote our attention to:
* Creating and Auditing Trustworthy Statistics and Machine Learning:
    * Data Privacy and Security
    * Trust in Data Models and Curation Mechanisms
* Machine Learning on Structured Data and Outcomes
    * Relational Learning on Graphs
    * Scientific Data
    * Spatiotemporal and Statistical Databases
    * Interpretable Machine Learning

Other Data Engineering topics
