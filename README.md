## Overview

The **DACES** (**D**ata structures and **A**lgorithms for **C**ommunication **E**ngineering **S**afety) is a research group devoted to the study of algorithms, complexity theory, and data structures for ensuring the trust, reliability, and security of communications infrastructure. We aim to design and analyze algorithms for trustworthy systems with provable guarantees on communication cost, privacy levels, and statistical efficiency. To this end, we use a variety of mathematical and computational tools to advance the state-of-the-art.

## Topics

Here are some subject areas we devote our attention to:
* Creating and Auditing Trustworthy Statistics and Machine Learning:
    * Attack Models for Data Privacy and Security
    * Solution Models for Data Privacy and Security
    * Trust in Data Models and Curation Mechanisms
* Machine Learning on Structured Data and Outcomes:
    * Graph Embeddings and Relational Graph Learning
    * Scientific Data
    * Spatiotemporal and Statistical Databases
    * Interpretable Machine Learning
